# P5_Neighborhood_Map_Project
Project 5 Network Neighborhood Map

This website helps a user view interesting places in Lake County Ohio using the Google Maps API, Wikipedia API and Knockout JS JavaScript library.

Clicking on a pin will bring up a window which will display a link to a Wikipedia article and Street View (Google Maps API) of that location.

You can use the list at top left to go directly to the pin and infowwindow you would like.
And last of of all you can type in a name or portions of a name into the search box to filter the list.

How to run:

Go to my GitHub page: (http://mahoneyz.github.io/P5_Neighborhood_Map_Project - gh-pages).

You can use the 3 black horizonital lines to open a menu of stored places to visit
Then use the list at top left to go directly to the point of interest. This will change the red point blue and show the popup window with links to Wikipedia and a Google Street View photo.
You can also click directly on any pin on the map to do the same thing as clicking on the list item.
Additionally, you can sue the search box to filter the points of interest.
